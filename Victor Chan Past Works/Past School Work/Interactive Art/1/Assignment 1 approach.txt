I would want to allow users to be able to express their emotions with as little interpretation and quantification of affects from the system as possible, thus allowing for flexibility and expression of emotions. 

At the same time, I would consider how I can include areas of pliability, rhythm, dramaturgical structure and fluency into the interface.

As such, I am considering a flexible comic style approach, with a page of a book which people are able to slice the drawing board in shapes defined by them, insert photos, add filters to the photos and order the flow of the story. The reader should be able to either go for the journey as set by the creator, or explore by himself through the photos. The reader is also able to draw and stamp on the photo as interaction to the creator.
