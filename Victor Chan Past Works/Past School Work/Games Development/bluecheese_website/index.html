            <h2>Background Story</h2>
			<p>
			The world of cats is a ruthless one. It is where success was measured mainly by mouse kill count. Mouse kills give recognition
			amongst peers, and leads to receiving job requests from human employers who see your kill count as a resume for competence.
			</p>
			<p>
			Carter decends from THE most reputed cat family in the kitty world, the "Nekolite". Carter's grandfather, who was once known by
			one and all as the "Master Catcher", had his whole career ruined by he who went by the name of "The Flash", the mouse who had
			evaded capture for over a 100 years while wreaking havoc in human households everywhere. The Flash was the Master Catcher's one
			and only blemish in his otherwise perfect capture rate, and the latter passed away due to old age without ever beating the Flash
			in a 1 to 1 match.
			</p>
			<p>
			Other cats used this record to make jokes against the Nekolite family for being eternal failures after so many years of boasting
			a perfect capture rate. Carter, being a hot headed cat by nature, took these insults to heart and grew up habouring hatred
			against not only the Milako tribe, where the Flash originated from, but also against the kitty world for undermining the abilities
			of his dear family. He made a vow to master every technique known to the Nekolite family and use them to, one day, eliminate the
			Milako tribe once and for all.
			</p>
			<p>
			Mini is the young trainee mouse that was born into the famed Milako tribe and slated to take over the throne after his father
			passes on. He was taught by his master not to hate cats for taking the lives of their kind, but instead to search for a peaceful
			resolution for both parties. As a result, Mini does not believe in the act of killing cats, because he is well aware that it only
			perpetuates the vicious cycle of war and suffering currently going on.
			</p>
			<p>
			His master tells him on day, "I have no more to teach you, young rodent. You have been one of my brightest students, and I know
			that one day, one day you will be able to bring peace to the land. Venture into the outside world, young rodent. FInd the parts
			of the legendary Blue Cheese and piece them together. The Blue Cheese will tell you exactly what to do. Seek to understand, not
			to hate. I will always be with you in spirit." As such, young Mini sets off on a quest in search of this peaceful resolution that
			his master so desires.
			</p>
			<p>
			Carter and Mini crossed paths on a stormy night in the battlefield. "You!", shouted Carter. "Are you one of the Milako mouse
			tribe?" Not knowing anything, Mini innocently replied, "Yes, what of it?" "At last. I have searched the land far and wide for a
			chance to kill you and your people. Now that I've found you, there is no escape. You will pay for what you've done to my
			grandfather!" Carter's eyes were blazing with anticipation and fury. "This must be the hatred that my master spoke of." thought
			Mini. "I don't even know what he's talking about! What should I do?"
			</p>
			<p>
			What will become of Mini? Will he be able to convince Carter to put his hatred down and seek the inner peace that he himself
			posseses? Or will he succumb to Carter's overwhelming desire for vengence? And what will the Blue Cheese reveal?

			<p>Mini (played by the AI) is an intelligent mouse that relies on fuzzy logic and smart exploration algorithm to find the
			cheese. He is skilled at escaping and avoiding Carter (played by the player). Mini has a stun gun that he will decide to use
			base on a fuzzy logic algorithm.</p>
			<p>However, Carter is not handicap as he has his own mouse traps and weapons to kill the mouse. Overall, it is a fair game and
			the winner is decided based on the points accumulated.</p>
